            <h4>The Problem</h4>


        <p>
        The <code>TennisSuperVillian</code> is hell-bent on destroying earth. Humans have one last hope:
		the great tennis player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams">Serena Williams <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i></a>:

                        </div>
        </p>

        <p>Serena has two choices to neutralize <code>TennisSuperVillian</code>.
		The first choice is to nuke <code>TennisSuperVillian</code>’s hideout. The second choice is to defeat the <code>TennisSuperVillian</code> in his own game. Serena has to beat <code>TennisSuperVillian</code> in $n$ special rallies. The $i^{th}$
		rally ($0\leq i\leq n-1$) needs a given amount of time $t_{i}$ and it has to be finished by time $f_{i}$ . Each of these
		rallies are complex and (even) Serena can only play one rally at a time and each rally once it has
		been started has to be completed without interruption (otherwise <code>TennisSuperVillian</code> wins
		and the earth gets destroyed). <code>TennisSuperVillian</code> is cunning and has made sure that the only way
		to defeat him is to finish each rally $i$ by time $f_{i}$ . You should also assume that Serena cannot
		start any of the rallies before time 0. (Also assume that all the $t_{i}$ and $f_{i}$ are positive integers.)</p>

		<p>
		Serena also has intelligence that <code>TennisSuperVillian</code> has planned an imminent attack soon and she
		does not have time to try out both choices. </p>

		<p>
		Obviously Serena wants to avoid the first choice because of the collateral damage. However, as
		mentioned earlier time is short and Serena needs to decide if she can go with the second choice.
		During her training, she skipped the class on greedy algorithms. Your task is to design an algorithm for Serena that will help her make her decision in time
		$O(n \log(n))$. </p>

            <h4>Input</h4>
            <ul>
            	<li> The first line of the input file will have the number $n$, indicating the number of rallies</li>
            	<li> The next $n$ lines will have the durations ($t_{i}$) and deadlines ($f_{i}$)  for the $n$ rallies (separated by spaces)</li>
            	<li> The index of the line under consideration is the ID of that rally. For instance line 0 of the input file (not including the line displaying $n$) has the duration ($t_{0}$) and deadline ($f_{0}$) of rally 0
            </ul>

            <pre class="prettyprint">
            	n		<- Number of rallies Serena has to play
                t<sub>0</sub> f<sub>0</sub>		<- Duration t<sub>0</sub> and deadline f<sub>0</sub> of rally 0
            	t<sub>1</sub> f<sub>1</sub>		<- Duration t<sub>1</sub> and deadline f<sub>1</sub> of rally 1
            	t<sub>2</sub> f<sub>2</sub>		<- Duration t<sub>2</sub> and deadline f<sub>2</sub> of rally 2
		.
		.
		.
		t<sub>n-1</sub> f<sub>n-1</sub>		<- Duration t<sub>n-1</sub> and deadline f<sub>n-1</sub> of rally n-1	    </pre>

	    <p>For example:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
        6		<- Serena needs to play 6 rallies
        5 16		<- Rally 0 has a duration of 5 and needs to finish by 16
        7 18    	<- Rally 1 has a duration of 7 and needs to finish by 18
        10 28		<- Rally 2 has a duration of 10 and needs to finish by 28
        12 45		<- Rally 3 has a duration of 12 and needs to finish by 45
        4 11		<- Rally 4 has a duration of 4 and needs to finish by 11
        3 29		<- Rally 5 has a duration of 3 and needs to finish by 29
	    </pre>

	    <h4>Output</h4>
	    	<p> If you decide that Serena should play out all the rallies, you should output a list of pairs (rally ID, rally start time).</p>

            <p> If you decide that the only option Serena has is to nuke <code>TennisSuperVillian</code>'s hideout, output an empty list.</p>

                                <p>You are given two coding files: <code>Driver.cpp</code> and <code>Solution.cpp</code>. <code>Driver.cpp</code> takes the input file, parses it and creates an instance of the class <code>Solution</code> and calls the <code>outputRallies()</code> method on it. It then prints the schedule produced. You only need to update the <code>Solution.cpp</code> file. You may write your own helper methods and data structures in it.</p>
                                <p>The testcases folder has 3 input files and their corresponding output files for your reference. We will use these three input files (and seven others) in our autograding. The output files provided are not the ONLY solutions. They only represent an example of a schedule from each of the inputs.</p>
