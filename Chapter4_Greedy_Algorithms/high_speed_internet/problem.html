            <h4>The Problem</h4>

                <p>We come back to the issue of many USA regions not having high speed internet. In this question, you will consider an algorithmic problem that you would need to solve to help out a (fictional) place get high speed Internet.</p>
                <p>You are the algorithms whiz in the effort to bring high speed Internet to <code>SomePlaceInUSA</code>. After lots of rounds of discussions and public feedback, it was decided that the most cost-effective way to bring high speed internet to <code>SomePlaceInUSA</code> was to install high speed cell towers to connect all houses in <code>SomePlaceInUSA</code> to high speed internet. There are two things in your favor:
                    <ol>
                        <li>It just so happens that all of  the $n$ houses in <code>SomePlaceInUSA</code> are on the side of a straight road that runs through the town.</li>
                        <li>The above implies that you only need cell towers that only need to broadcast their signal in a narrow range, which means one cell tower can provide high speed internet access to all houses within $100$ miles <i>ahead</i> (rather than the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_site#Range" target="_blank">45 mile range <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i></a>) on the road from its location (we are assuming that these cell towers will be on the side of the road). These cell towers are unidirectional so they can provide connection to only houses that are ahead of it.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Due to various logistical reasons, the cell towers have to be on the side of the straight road and right next to a house.
                </p>
                <p> None of your team-mates attended the class on greedy algorithms, so
in this problem you will design an efficient algorithm for them, which your team can use to figure out which houses  should have cell towers installed next to them so as to <i>use the minimum number of cell towers</i>.</p>

                <p>With an eye on the future, the cell towers have to be placed so that there is continuous cell coverage on the road from the first and the last house on the road. I.e. it should never be the case that you are on the road (between the first and the last house) such that you are
strictly more than $100$ miles <i>ahead</i> of the closest cell tower.  You can assume that you have to put a cell tower at the first house on the road in <code>SomePlaceInUSA</code>.
                </p>
                    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
                        <h4>Note</h4>
                            <p>You should assume the following for your algorithm:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>No two consecutive houses are more than $99$ miles apart. Note that this implies there always exists a feasible way to assign cell towers to houses. Further, note that houses can be much closer than $99$ miles to each other.</li>
                                    <li>The input to your algorithm is a list of houses along with their distance (in miles) from the very first house. You cannot assume that this list is sorted in any way.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                    </div>

                <p>Here are the two two parts of the problem:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Part <kbd>(a)</kbd>: Assume that we relax the condition that the cell towers have to be next to house: i.e. you can place a cell tower anywhere on the road (the $100$ mile coverage restriction on the cell towers still applies). Design an $O(n)$ time algorithm to solve this related problem.</p>
                        <li> Part <kbd>(b)</kbd>: Design an $O(n\log{n})$ time algorithm to solve the original problem (i.e. where the cell towers have to be next to a house). Prove the correctness of your algorithm and analyze its running time.</li>
                    </ul>



            </p>


            </div>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-success">
            <h4><i class="fa fa-key"></i> Hint</h4>
            <p>Think of a greedy way to decide on which houses to pick for cell tower installation. It might help to forget about the scheduling algorithms we have seen in class and just think of a greedy algorithm
from "scratch." Then try to analyze the algorithm using similar arguments to one we have seen in class.

                    <h4><i class="fa fa-ban"></i> Common Mistake</h4>
                        <p>One common mistake is to present a correct greedy algorithm to solve this problem but then not proving that their algorithm is optimal, i.e. among all feasible assignments of cell towers to houses (i.e. all allocations that result in high speed internet in all houses in <code>SomePlaceInUSA</code>) the algorithms output should have the fewest number of cell towers in them.</p>

            <h4>The Problem</h4>


        <p>
        The <code>TennisSuperVillian</code> is hell-bent on destroying earth. Humans have one last hope:
		the great tennis player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams">Serena Williams <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i></a>:
                        <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-md-3"></div>
                                <div class="col-md-6">
                                        <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
                                                <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" width="50%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F1nI2BV2CR0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                                       </div>
                                </div>
                        </div>
        </p>

        <p>Serena has two choices to neutralize <code>TennisSuperVillian</code>.
		The first choice is to nuke <code>TennisSuperVillian</code>’s hideout. The second choice is to defeat the <code>TennisSuperVillian</code> in his own game. Serena has to beat <code>TennisSuperVillian</code> in $n$ special rallies. The $i^{th}$
		rally ($0\leq i\leq n-1$) needs a given amount of time $t_{i}$ and it has to be finished by time $f_{i}$ . Each of these
		rallies are complex and (even) Serena can only play one rally at a time and each rally once it has
		been started has to be completed without interruption (otherwise <code>TennisSuperVillian</code> wins
		and the earth gets destroyed). <code>TennisSuperVillian</code> is cunning and has made sure that the only way
		to defeat him is to finish each rally $i$ by time $f_{i}$ . You should also assume that Serena cannot
		start any of the rallies before time 0. (Also assume that all the $t_{i}$ and $f_{i}$ are positive integers.)</p>

		<p>
		Serena also has intelligence that <code>TennisSuperVillian</code> has planned an imminent attack soon and she
		does not have time to try out both choices. </p>

		<p>
		Obviously Serena wants to avoid the first choice because of the collateral damage. However, as
		mentioned earlier time is short and Serena needs to decide if she can go with the second choice.
		During her training, she skipped the class on greedy algorithms. Your task is to design an algorithm for Serena that will help her make her decision in time
		$O(n \log(n))$. </p>

            <h4>Input</h4>
            <ul>
            	<li> The first line of the input file will have the number $n$, indicating the number of rallies</li>
            	<li> The next $n$ lines will have the durations ($t_{i}$) and deadlines ($f_{i}$)  for the $n$ rallies (separated by spaces)</li>
            	<li> The index of the line under consideration is the ID of that rally. For instance line 0 of the input file (not including the line displaying $n$) has the duration ($t_{0}$) and deadline ($f_{0}$) of rally 0
            </ul>

            <pre class="prettyprint">
            	n		<- Number of rallies Serena has to play

            	t<sub>1</sub> f<sub>1</sub>		<- Duration t<sub>1</sub> and deadline f<sub>1</sub> of rally 1
            	t<sub>2</sub> f<sub>2</sub>		<- Duration t<sub>2</sub> and deadline f<sub>2</sub> of rally 2
		.
		.
		.
		t<sub>n-1</sub> f<sub>n-1</sub>		<- Duration t<sub>n-1</sub> and deadline f<sub>n-1</sub> of rally n-1	    </pre>

	    <p>For example:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
        6		<- Serena needs to play 6 rallies
        5 16		<- Rally 0 has a duration of 5 and needs to finish by 16
        7 18    	<- Rally 1 has a duration of 7 and needs to finish by 18
        10 28		<- Rally 2 has a duration of 10 and needs to finish by 28
        12 45		<- Rally 3 has a duration of 12 and needs to finish by 45
        4 11		<- Rally 4 has a duration of 4 and needs to finish by 11
        3 29		<- Rally 5 has a duration of 3 and needs to finish by 29
	    </pre>

	    <h4>Output</h4>
	    	<p> If you decide that Serena should play out all the rallies, you should output a list of pairs (rally ID, rally start time).</p>

            <p> If you decide that the only option Serena has is to nuke <code>TennisSuperVillian</code>'s hideout, output an empty list.</p>
