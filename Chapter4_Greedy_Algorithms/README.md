# List of Problems

- [Road Closures due to Political Rally](political_rally) Students need to design an algorithm that computes the shortest path between two points given road closures (due to political rally) or heavy traffic (due to some road being closed due to COVID related reasons). Students then discuss implications of their algorithm being used in real life (proof+discussion based question).
- [High Speed Internet](high_speed_internet) Students needs to design a greedy algorithm to place network towers (proof based question).
- [Designing Routing Algorithms for an Internet Service Provider](spectrum_lawsuit) Students design routing algorithms to route packets for an Internet service provider based on various constraints (based on NY AG's lawsuit againt Spectrum). This is a coding project.
- [College Scheduling Project](college_scheduling) A long term (~2 months) coding and research paper project where students design and analyze an automated scheduler for a college registrar.
