                        <h1>Some Suggestions and Warnings</h1>

                            <p>While this coding mini-project is somewhat similar to Question 3s on the homework, there are some crucial differences and we wanted to highlight few things for y'all upfront:

                                <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-primary">
                                    <h4>Form groups of size $\le 3$</h4>
                                        <p>This is a group project (unlike Q3s on the HWs that had to be done individually) and you can work in groups of size <strong>at most 3</strong>. The submissions will be on Autolab and <i>everyone in the group will get the same grade.</i> The project will be challenging so <strong>we highly recommend that you form a group of size at least 2 to make the workload reasonable</strong>.
                                </div>

                                <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-success">
                                    <h4>Groups should agree on one programming language</h4>
                                        <p>While the submission in this project can be done in any of <code>C++,Java</code> and <code>Python</code> like in Question 3s on the homework, we <strong>highly recommend that the group agrees on one programming language for the group</strong>. This will make it much easier for your group to make progress and collaborate.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
                                    <h4>The same group for ALL problems</h4>
                                        <p>You are expected to work in the <strong>same</strong> group for <strong>ALL</strong> problems in the coding project. <strong>Not doing so will be considered to be an academic integrity violation.</strong> Please note that you will have to sign up your group separately for each problem on Autolab and we will check for group consistency at the <i>end of the semester</i>. So please make sure you follow this rule.</p>
                                        <p><i>There is ONE exception to the above rule:</i> It is OK if the group becomes smaller (e.g. if a group member resigns) but in that case another student cannot be added to group. If you need clarification on this, please get in touch with Atri.</p>
                                </div>


                                <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                                    <h4>There are no optimal algorithms known!</h4>
                                        <p>Other than the first problem, we do not know of optimal algorithms to solve the rest of the problems and we suspect that doing so is not possible (definitely not within a semester). Note that this is unlike the HW Q3s where your code is supposed to always output the optimal/correct solution: i.e. you will have to think of algorithms where you might not be able to prove any guarantee on how good your output is.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-default">
                                    <h4>Start early!</h4>
                                        <p>There is a reason we are giving y'all about two months to do this project. If your group starts even the week before the project is due, your group will be in trouble especially beyond the first problem. Also for <strong>most problems you will have to think of algorithms beyond what we cover in class</strong>, so the more time your spend on this, the better.
                                </div>

                                <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
                                    <h4>Optimizing the runtime of your code is NOT the main objective</h4>
                                        <p>Unlike the HW Q3s, there will be no timeouts for individual inputs (though there will be one overall per submission). This is because unlike the HW Q3s, the main goal in this coding project submissions will be to generate as much "revenue" as possible (read on for more details on this)-- optimizing the runtime would/should be a secondary object but again there is an overall timeout so really inefficient implementations (and definitely not polynomial runtime algorithms) will not make the cut.</p>

Now imagine that you just graduated from UB with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering/Computer Science and got hired by <code>ForProfitOnly</code> Internet provider. You're recruited into  <code>ForProfitOnly</code> as a junior software engineer. It's your first day at work and your first assignment/task is to come up with routing algorithms to generate paths that will be used to route packets in <code>ForProfitOnly's</code> network topology. Since it's your first day at work, you're very eager to please your superiors by delivering as much revenue as possible to <code>ForProfitOnly</code>. Below is a detailed description of your task and the various problems that you need to solve. </p>

For each of the problems 1-5 (see below), you will need to come up with an algorithm that outputs a path to route packets from the content provider node $i \in V$ to every client in $C$ with some given constraints.

                                            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-success">

                                                    <p>In this project, there is a central algorithm that chooses an $i-c$ path for each client $c$. This is <strong>not</strong> how routing happens on the Internet. In particular, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol" target="_blank">TCP/IP <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i></a> protocol is a <strong>distributed</strong> protocol. However, distributed algorithms are out of the scope of this course.</p>
                                            </div>
Every problem will have an objective that you need to optimize. </p>

                                <p>Let $P$ be any path from the content provider node $i \in V$ to some client node $c \in C$. We define $D(P)$ to be the sum of the delay of all edges in path $P$. That is, $D(P) = \sum_{e \in P} d_e$. </p>


                                <p>For every client $c\in C$, let $d(c)$ be the minimum of $D(P_c)$ among all $i-c$ paths $P_c$. Let $P'_c$ be the actual $i-c$ path determined by your algorithm for client $c$. As defined above $D(P'_c) = \sum_{e \in P'_c} d_e$.</p>

                                <p>Every node $u\in V$ has a bandwidth $b_u$, a bound on the number of packets it can send in each time step.

                                                    <p>Note that we are not putting any restriction on how many packets a router can <i>receive</i> in each time step. We make this simplification so that the problems are a bit simpler.</p>
                                            </div>
We will assume that the bandwidth of the ISP node is very large. That is, $b_i$ is a very large value</p>

                                                <h2>Routing of packets</h2>
                                <p>Every client $c \in C$ has a priority, which is given by $\text{priority(c)}$.

                                            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
                                                <h4>Larger value is higher priority</h4>
                                                    <p>$\text{priority(c)}$ is a positive integer and a larger value implies a higher priority.</p>
                                            </div>
 By default, for all $c \in C$, $\text{priority(c)}$ = <span style="color: red;">PRIORITY_DEFAULT</span> = 0. You are not allowed to change/set the priority unless it is explicitly allowed in a problem. </p>

                                <p>The content provider node $i$ will send out a packet to all clients simultaneously. This packet will be routed through the path $P'_c$ for each client $c$ that your algorithm outputs.
                                            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-success">

                                                    <p>We make the simplifying assumption that packets $\text{pkt}_c$ for all clients $c$ are ready to be routed out of $i$ at the same time. This in real-life is not necessary since different clients might request their packets at different times. Again, this simplification makes the problems easier.</p>
                                            </div>
The routing will take place in time steps. That is, at every time step the packet will be transmitted to the next node in $P'_c$ until it reaches $c$. During the routing, if there is some router $u \in P'_c$ s.t. $u \neq c$ and $b_u$ is less than the number of packets that need to be transmitted a timestep, then $|b_u|$ number of packets belonging to clients of higher priority are transmitted in that timestep. Once the packet requested by client $c$ reaches it, $c$ will accept the packet.</p>

                                                        The routing simulator will proceed iteratively, with each iteration mapping directly to a time ‘tick’. Inside each time tick, all the clients are processed and time is advanced only once this processing is finished.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                        The list of clients, initially maintained as an array (since linked list sorting is slow), will first be sorted by priority, which ensures only the highest priority packets get forwarded if there are bandwidth restrictions.
                                                        The list is then converted to a Linked List so that as soon as a packet has reached, the client can be removed from the list.

                                                        The simulation iterates until all the packets have reached the end of their path. This condition is true when the list of clients is empty.

                                                        At each time tick, check if a packet has reached its destination. If it has, remove the client from the list of clients. The client’s delay is set to either the packet delay or infinity depending on whether the packet reached its intended client or not (respectively). Finally, skip to processing the next client.
                                                </p>

                                                        If the packet is still in transit, its delay is incremented. It is then “forwarded” if the node it is currently at has enough bandwidth and after checking that the corresponding edge is valid. Forwarding comprises incrementing its location by 1 and decrementing the current node’s available bandwidth.

                                                        After each time tick, the bandwidth is reset to the router’s $b_u$ value for all routers that participated in the forwarding.

                                         <h4 id="p1_pen">Penalty</h4>
                                         <p>The notion of penalty for this problem is the revenue loss that <code>ForProfitOnly</code> has to face. In this problem, it is possible to lose money only if some clients unsubscribe from ForProfitOnly due to its poor service (slow internet). A client $c \in C$ may unsubscribe from <code>ForProfitOnly</code> if $c$'s internet is slow enough to "beat" $c$'s tolerance threshold $\alpha_c$.</p>


                                             <p>More precisely, let  $P'_c$ be the $i-c$ path generated by your algorithm to route packets from $i$ to $c$. Then if $D(P'_c)$ exceeds $\alpha_c \cdot d(c)$, then $c$ unsubscribes from <code>ForProfitOnly</code>, and <code>ForProfitOnly</code> does not receive $c$'s payment $\text{pmt}_c$. This causes a drop in ForProfitOnly's revenue. Thus, the penalty that <code>ForProfitOnly</code> faces from client $c$ is either $\text{pmt}_c$ or nothing (which is 0). This calculation is done by the $pen_0$ function for each client $c \in C$. Below is a formal description of penalty function:</p>

                                              <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                                                  <li>$pen_0(c, D(P'_c),\alpha_c, d(c),\text{pmt}_c)$ is the penalty function that accounts for the client/revenue loss that  <code>ForProfitOnly</code> faces  due to client $c \in C$. $pen_0$ has five inputs:
                                                        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                                                            <li>client $c \in C$</li>
                                                            <li>$D(P'_c)$ which is the total delay of $i-c$ path generated by your algorithm</li>
                                                            <li>$\alpha_c$ which is the tolerance of client $c$</li>
                                                            <li>$d(c)$ which is the minimum delay of any $i-c$ path</li>
                                                            <li>$\text{pmt}_c$ for $c \in C$</li>
                                                        </ul>
                                                  </li>
                                             </ul>
                                        <p> If  $D(P'_c) > \alpha_c \cdot  d(c)$, then client $c$ unsubscribes from <code>ForProfitOnly</code>(and subscribes to some other ISP or say uses their cell phone as a way of connecting to the internet). So you lose their portion of the revenue. Otherwise, $pen_0(c,D(P'_c),\alpha_c,d(c),\text{pmt}_c)$ outputs $0$. </p>

                                            <p>Thus, for this problem, $pen_0(c,D(P'_c),\alpha_c,d(c),\text{pmt}_c) = \begin{cases} \text{pmt}_c &\text{if} \quad D(P'_c)  >\alpha_c \cdot d(c) \\ 0 &\text{ otherwise} \end{cases}$ </p>


                                      <h4 id="p1_rev">Revenue</h4>
                                                <p><code>ForProfitOnly</code> receives a payment $\text{pmt}_c$ from every client $c \in C$ unless $c$ has unsubscribed from <code>ForProfitOnly's</code> services. This means that <code>ForProfitOnly</code> receives nothing or a $0$ payment from any client $c$ who has unsubscribed from its services. Thus, we can define revenue from client $c$ as the payment received from $c$ minus the penalty faced due to $c$. This is calculation is done by the $rev$ function for each client $c \in C$. Below is a formal description of $rev$ function:</p>

                                                <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                                                    <li>Let $rev(c, D(P'_c),\alpha_c,d(c),\text{pmt}_c)$ be the revenue received from client $c$. Here, $rev(c, D(P'_c),\alpha_c,d(c),\text{pmt}_c) = \text{pmt}_c - pen_0(c,D(P'_c),\alpha_c,d(c),\text{pmt}_c)$</li>

                                                <p>If the graph $G$ for this problem is our graph from Example 0, then here is a valid output (see the figure below): </p>

                                             <p>That is, the output $L_{P'} = [P'_1,P'_3,P'_6,P'_7,P'_8]$. Where, $P'_1 = [0,10,1], P'_3 = [0,9,3], P'_6 = [0,9,3,6], P'_7 = [0,10,1,4,7], P'_8 = [0,9,3,8]$.   </p>

                                             <p>Since each $b_c = \infty$ ,for $c \in \{1,3,6,7,8\}$, the optimal routing protocol  will incur a delay $d(c)$ for each $c$.  This is because for each path P’_c, we will have  $D(P'_c) =  d(c)$ (see below for bit more details). Thus, for all $c \in C$, $pen_0(c) = 0$ because $D(P'_c) = d(c)$. So $rev(c) = \text{pmt}_c$, and thus total revenue would simply be the sum of payments from each client. </p>

                                             <h4>Justification for claim on revenue</h4>
                                             <p>Since all $b_c = \infty$, the routing protocol will incur a delay of $d(c)$. This is because for each path $P’_c$, we will have $D(P’_c)$ is the number of edges in $P'_c$  and further, for each $P’_c$ above, this is also $d(c)$. Thus, in this case we have $pen_0(c) = 0$. For example, we have  $d(1)=2$, which is also the number of edges in $P'_2$: i.e.  $D(P’_1) = 2$. Since $d(1)$ is the shortest possible delay we have found an optimal solution for path $P'_1$ and experience no penalty. A similar argument works for the rest of the clients.

In addition, Spectrum-TWC failed to make adjustments to its network, such as reducing the size of service groups and increasing the number of channels for each service group, that would enable a subscriber to achieve the promised speeds. Not only did Spectrum-TWC fail to deliver the promised Internet speeds, it repeatedly assured subscribers that they could achieve the same results with wireless as with a wired connection, even when it knew that the wireless connection suffered from unavoidable, real-world limitations.<i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></p>

                                            <p>We will consider the paths given above to compute the penalties for each client. So for path $1$, $\alpha_1\cdot d(1)$ is $1 \cdot 2$, which is $2$. Next we compare that to our $D(P’_1)$, by finding the number of edges in each path and making sure that there is enough bandwidth to transfer packets each tick.  If our $D(P’_c)$ is less than or equal to  $\alpha_c\cdot d(c)$ value we receive no penalty. For notational convenience (in our worked out calculation below), if  $D(P’_c) \leq \alpha_c \cdot d(c)$ we say <em>“accept”</em>, else <em>“reject”</em>.</p>

                                            <p>Now consider this allegation made by the NY AG against <code>Spectrum</code> on page 9 and point 14 from the <a href = "https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/summons_and_complaint.pdf">AG's allegations<i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i></a>:</p>

                                                         <div class="quotes">
                                                         <p><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>Spectrum-TWC fraudulently induced at least 640,000 subscribers in New York State to sign up for high-speed plans that it knew it could not provide. SpectrumTWC knowingly failed to allocate sufficient bandwidth to subscribers, which it could have done either by reducing the size of its service groups or adding more channels to each service group.<i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></p>
                                                         </div>

                                            <p>Thus for this problem, you are <strong>allowed</strong> to increase the bandwidth for every router, that is you can increase $b_u$ for all $u \in V \setminus \{i\}$ at a cost of $\$Z$ per increase in bandwidth.
                                            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-success">

                                                    <p>As alluded to above, increase the bandwidth for a node actually means changing the hardware and hence, this change has a real life cost. However, to simplify the problem we are assuming that there is a per-unit cost associated with increasing the bandwidths while in real life, these cost increases comes in quantums.</p>
                                            </div>
</p>


                                            <p>Let $X$ be the total increase of bandwidths over all routers. For any router $u \in V \setminus \{i\}$, let $b_u$ be its original bandwidth. And let $b'_u$ be the new increased bandwidth of $u$. If you chose not to increase the bandwidth of $u$, then $b_u = b'_u$. We define $X$ to be
\[\sum_{u \in V \setminus \{i\}} \max(0,b'_u - b_u).\]
                                            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
                                                <h4>Why the $\max$ term?</h4>
                                                    <p>The $\max$ term above seems un-necessary because one would expect $b'_u\ge b_u$. However, since your code will be outputting the $b'_u$ values, the $\max$ above makes it so that y'all have no incentive to make $b'_u&lt;b_u$.</p>

                                            <p>For this problem, we also introduce an additional parameter, $\beta_c$ which is the complaint threshold ($\beta_c \le \alpha_c$). A client $c$ may "complain" if $\beta_c \cdot  d(c) &lt;  D(P'_c)$.</p>

In this case its a <b>double whammy</b> for <code>ForProfitOnly</code>.</p>

                                            <p>Let $S$ be a subset of clients, and let $\rho_{\text{fcc}}$ and $\rho_{\text{lawsuit}}$ be a real numbers between $0$ and $1$. Let $Comp$ be a subset of clients in $S$ ($Comp \subseteq S$) that complain, that is for all $c \in Comp$, $D(P'_c) &gt; \beta_c \cdot d(c)$ (and for $c\not\in Comp$, they do not satisfy this constraint).</p>


                                            <p>If the size of $Comp$ is big enough, then it is safe to assume that the Office of the Attorney General will also have received a sizable number of complaints, prompting it to investigate potential wrongdoing and to consider filing a lawsuit to enforce laws that prohibit fraudulent or deceptive business practices and false advertising.
In <code>Spectrum</code>'s case, where since 2015 the OAG fielded over 2,800 reports from <code>Spectrum</code>'s subscribers who complained about Spectrum's poor internet service.</p>

This makes intuitive sense and seems to capture an important piece of how agencies decide whether to take action in the real world.  That said, there are many other factors that influence a decision to bring a lawsuit – e.g. the possibility of deterrence by taking on a “high profile” target, the agency leadership’s idiosyncratic priorities, the political benefit to the agency, desire for good headlines, etc.  So it can certainly happen that an enforcement action begins with only a few complaints—or even with none, if someone in the AG’s office chooses to undertake an investigation for some other reason.  We stress that the above is a stylized model and that you shouldn’t assume that you can get away with breaking the law if you somehow manage to avoid complaints being filed.</p>

That is the court could issue a court-order requiring the company to implement specific measures going forward in order to fix the deceptive/fraudulent practice.

These kinds  of court-ordered changes will often be costly to implement, but the company must comply irrespective of how much it costs to do so. In the context of this problem, it is very likely (in the real world) for the court to order <code>ForProfitOnly</code> to increase the bandwidth of <em>all</em> routers if <code>ForProfitOnly</code> was found to have violated the law.</p>

Next we compare that to our $D(P’_1)$ which is $2$. Since our $D(P’_1)$ is not less than our $\beta_1 \cdot D(1)$, the customer does not complain. In the same way, we can check this for all other clients:</p>

                                                <p>FCC: 0</p>
                                                <p>Lawsuit:0</p>
                                            <p>Now that we have our total of complaining customers we find the fraction of the group they represent and compare it to our $\rho$ values (i.e. $\rho_{\text{lawsuit}}$ and $\rho_{\text{fcc}}$ for the two cases). If the fraction of complaining clients $&gt; \rho$, then no fine is awarded.</p>

                                            <p>FCC: $\frac{0}{5} &lt; 0.5$, i.e., NO fine</p>

                                            <p>Thus, $pen_1 = 0$ (for both cases).</p>
                                            <p>Now, in order to calculate the revenue we subtract $pen_0$ and $pen_1$, and our bandwidth changes from our total possible revenue. </p>
                                            <p>So, total revenue $= \$190 - \$0 - \$0 - (2 \cdot \$15) = \$160 $</p>

                                    <p>Currently, we are able to avoid both the FCC fine and the lawsuit fines. This will not always be the case, consider if  $Z = \$45$ and $B = \$40$. In this case the total revenue for the Example 3 solution becomes $=\$190-2\cdot\$45=\$100$. By contrast Example 2 solution becomes the better solution.</p>

                                     <p>For a quick reference, these were the delay's produced by our solution algorithm for Problem 2's example: $D(P’_1) = 2, D(P’_3) = 4, D(P’_6) = 4, D(P’_7) = 4, D(P’_8) = 3$. And the output of the $pen_0$ function for clients in Problem 2 was: $pen_0(1) = 0, pen_0(3) = 0, pen_0(6) =35, pen_0(8) = 0$.</p>

                                                <p>Problem 2 did not have the $pen_1$ function unlike this problem. So let's see what $pen_1$ outputs with our solutions for Problem 2. (This is the same calculation that we did above for the earlier input-- nothing changes.)</p>

                                            <p>For this problem, you are <strong>allowed</strong> to set/change $\text{priority(c)}$ for all $c \in C$.</p>


                                                <p>Coming back to the story of <code>Spectrum</code>, NY AG alleged <code>Spectrum</code> knowingly took full advantage of the fact that its subscribers had very few choices for some other ISP. Thus, this essentially forced many of <code>Spectrum's</code> subscribers to stick with <code>Spectrum</code>. But nevertheless, <code>Spectrum</code> continued to deceive its subscribers. Here is the relevant allegation against Spectrum by the AG that states it (page 12 and point 23):</p>

                                                        <div class="quotes">

Capitalizing on the fact that its subscribers had few, if any, other choices for an ISP, Spectrum-TWC placed profits ahead of the interests of its subscribers, and collected billions of dollars in fees from New York subscribers for providing Internet service.<i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></p>
                                                        </div>



                                            <p>Now, for this problem, you are given a subset $R$ of clients that live in rural areas where <code>ForProfitOnly</code> is a monopoly. Thus, every rural client has an infinite tolerance threshold, because rural clients will never unsubscribe from <code>ForProfitOnly's</code> services even if they are unhappy with the service because they simply do not have any other choice. However, rural clients can still complain. As per the above AG's allegation, <code>Spectrum</code> took advantage of the fact that it was a monopoly in the region.</p>

                                                <p>The court <em>may</em> also order for the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disgorgement.asp">disgorgement <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i></a> of revenues that resulted from fraudulent and illegal practices (i.e. company has to turn over illegally gotten gains). In our problem, although the rural clients cannot unsubscribe (but of course they can complain) from <code>ForProfitOnly's</code> services, in the real-world if these complains are forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General (OAG), then it is very much likely that <code>ForProfitOnly</code> would have to turn over illegally gotten gains with <strong>interest</strong> to those affected by the action.</p>

                                                <p>Below are the total number of complaints for the two cases:</p>

                                                <p>Lawsuit: $1$</p>
                                            <p>Now that we have our total of complaining customers we find the fraction of the group they represent and compare it to our $\rho$ values. If the fraction of complaining clients &lt; $\rho$ , then no fine is awarded.</p>

                                            <p>Thus, $pen_1 = 0$ (for both cases).</p>

                                            <h4>The Problem</h4>
                                            <p>Like <code>Spectrum</code>, <code>ForProfitOnly</code> gets hit with multiple lawsuits and you decide it is a good time to work for another company where profit is not the only motive. Luckily for you, a new startup <code>EthicalInternet</code> promises to keep customers first and then worry about profit. More precisely, <code>EthicalInternet</code> will guarantee that no customer would complain/drop-out. You apply for a position at <code>EthicalInternet</code> and you get the job: congratulations! You have a similar problem to solve as you did when you were at <code>ForProfitOnly</code> but now your objectives are different.</p>


                                                <p>For this problem, there is <strong>no</strong> notion of a complaining client (but see the definition of penalty for how we will ensure that no customer would dropout). You are still <strong>allowed</strong> to set/change the priority for every client, and increase the bandwidth for any router at a cost of $\$Z$ per increase in bandwidth like before.</p>

                                                    <p>The input for the problem is the same as the previous one except for the bandwidth being limited and the tolerance threshold for every client being an arbitrary value greater than or equal to $1$. To put it formally,  following is the input:</p>

If there exists even one client $c \in C$ s.t. $D(P'_c) > \alpha_c \cdot d(c)$, then <code>EthicalInternet</code> will not  charge <strong>any</strong> of its clients -- i.e. its revenue would be $0$.

One could envision another version of this problem, where one could charge customers proportional to $\frac{d(c)}{D(P'_c)}$. This way you do get some revenue if some customer gets a slow service but in that case customers with slower speeds would pay less compared with those who get faster speeds. However, in the latter case there might still be an incentive to say give no service to some clients at all, if it sped up other customer's service.</p>
                                                    <p>Here is a questions for y'all to ponder on: if you owned <code>EthicalInternet</code>, what metric would you use to ensure a "minimum happiness" for your customers? <!--Please post your thoughts on <A href="https://piazza.com/buffalo/fall2019/cse331/home" target="_blank">piazza <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-sm"></i></a>.!--></p>

But if there is a client $c \in C$ with this property, then the total revenue would be $-X\cdot Z$. To put it mathematically: </p>

This <code>Info</code> object is passed on to <code>Solution.java</code>, and you may access all the data needed from this <code>Info</code> object. In <code>Solution.java</code> you should implement the <code>outputPaths()</code> method which returns a <code>SolutionObject</code> object, and of course you can add your own data structures in <code>Solution.java</code>.</p>

These files are merely required to do some processing in the background. For example, <code>Enums.py</code> is used in conjunction with the file I/O code. <code>LinkedList.py</code> is an implementation of a linked list in Python since there is no standard one.
                                            </p>
                                                
                                            <p><code>Driver.py</code> takes the input file, parses it using <code>Utility.py</code> and calls your <code>Solution.py</code> class' <code>output_paths()</code> method on data structures it creates.
                                                The $i-c$ paths output by you (along with, depending on the question, the updated bandwidths and packet priorities) are passed in to the routing simulator inside <code>Simulator.py</code>, which processes them and determines the routing delay faced by each client.
                                                Finally, these delays are passed into the revenue calculation function inside <code>Revenue.py</code>. It then prints the revenue you gathered based on your routing decisions. You only need to update the <code>Solution.py</code> file. You may write your own helper methods and data structures in it.</p>
                                            <p>The <code>Solution</code> class contains four data structures. 
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><code>problem</code>, which simply contains the problem number of the current template as a member variable on the Solution class. You DO NOT need to worry about this variable. </li>
                                                <li><code>isp</code> which is the ID of the ISP node. Note that this is the same as content provider or $i$ as mentioned in the problem description. </li>
                                                <li><code>graph</code> which is the input graph $G$ in the adjacency list representation that you are familiar with. The key is a node ID (not client, there are nodes that may not be clients) and the value is the list of nodes it is connected to. </li>
                                                <li><code>info</code> which is a mapping between a string representing the various input parameters and the corresponding data structure. For example, <code>info["bandwidths"]</code> lets you access the mapping between node IDs and their bandwidths. More details on <code>info</code> below.</li>
                                                
                                            </ul></p>

                                            <p>As outlined in the problem descriptions, there are various additional input parameters provided to you besides the graph, which you can use to influence the routing. These are available through the <code>info</code> data structure available as a member variable of the <code>Solution</code> class.
                                                The parameters are listed as follows:

                                                <li><code>bandwidths</code> [<code>dict</code>: node IDs (<code>int</code>) -> bandwidth (<code>int</code>)] maps $u\in V$ to $b_u$</li>

                                            To access each parameter, use the name exactly as given above as a key for the <code>info</code> data structure. For eg. <code>info["bandwidths"]</code> is a map from node IDs to their bandwidths, <code>info["lawsuit"]</code> is a floating point representing the amount of the lawsuit fine and so on. Note that not all parameters are available for each problem, for eg. Problem 1 and Problem 2 only have the first four available for use.

                                            <p> Your method is expected to return a <code>dictionary</code> indexed by client IDs with their $i$-$c$ path as the value. For problems 3, 4, 5 you also need to return a <code>dictionary</code> indexed by node IDs with their updated bandwidth as the value. For problems 4 and 5 you further need to return a <code>dictionary</code> indexed by client IDs with their priorities as the value. 
                                            As a reminder if you return an object you are not supposed to, for eg. priorities in problem 2, it will be ignored by the grader.</p>

                                                <p><code>Driver.cpp</code> takes the input file, parses it, using <code>MPUtility.h</code> and creates an instance of the class <code>Solution</code> and calls the <code>outputDistances()</code> method on it to determine the $i-c$ paths (and possibly bandwidths/ priorities). Then it uses those paths (and priorities/bandwidths where applicable) to run the <code>Simulator.cpp</code>, which processes them and determines the routing delay faced by each client. Finally these delays are passed into the revenue calculations in <code>Revenue.cpp</code>. It then prints the revenue you gathered based on your routing decisions. You only need to update the <code>Solution.cpp</code> file. You may write your own helper methods and data structures in it.

                                                    <li><code>graph</code> which is the input graph. It has a <code>unordered_map</code> that is the adjacency list representation of $G$, where the keys are the nodes and the values is a vector of its neighbors. There is also an <code>int</code>, <code>contentProvider</code> representing the content provider, or $i$.</li>
                                                    <li><code>clients</code> which represents a vector of all clients, or $C$. This will be explained more below.</li>

The number of testcases for each problem depends on the maximum points ($max\_points$) achievable, and is equal to $\frac{max\_points}{5}$. For eg. Problem 1 has one testcase, since it is worth 5 points, Problem 2 has two testcases, since it is worth 10 points and so on. </p>
                                                <p>For Problem 1, you get the full 5 points if your revenue matches ours and 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>For other problems, the thresholds are outlined below, the numbers on the left indicate the ratio of (your solution's revenue - revenue of optimal Solution  for Problem 1) and (our revenue - revenue from optimal Solution for Problem 1) in percentage, and the right half indicates the points achieving that ratio will award you. </p>
